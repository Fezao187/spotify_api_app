# Spotify API app

## How it works

    1. It uses the spotify api to get albums by searching for the artist.
    2. Users are able to create an account, login and add their favorite albums in the favourites page.
    3. Only the logged in user can edit their own favourites page.
    4. All the added albums will be added to the home page and show their names.
